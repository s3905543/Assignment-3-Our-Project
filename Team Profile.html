									<p>Student number s3763539.<br><br></p>
									<p> I was born in Australia and grew up in Melbourne and Bendigo. My hobbies can change depending on where I am living. But I do like to read crime novels to turn off my brain at night and engage in gardening to relax. I like IT as I find it challenging and it is always changing. My background in IT is that I started in telecommunications and moved into mainframe peripherals, then Netware servers. I then moved into networking with my last position as a senior consultant in a global network engineering team. </p>

							<p>My name is Joshua William Telfer and I was born on the 19th of July 1999 to my parents Robert and Joanne. I am the eldest of four brothers and despite my parents both having brown and black hair, I came out a ginger (lucky). I was raised in a typical middle class Australian home, having completed year 12 in 2017 and then moving straight into full time work. Going through high school, I loved rowing and found myself joining the school rowing team.

								<h1>David Jelbart</h1>

							<p>I was born in Australia and grew up in Werribee and Hoppers Crossing, having moved only one block in my life time. I have many hobbies but my primary one is video game playing, however I am also an avid book reader, and will play games with my dogs as well. I.T. is something that has interested me since childhood, a lot of my interest coming from my father. My background in I.T. is from the I.T. electives I took in high school and the working together on DIY I.T. home solutions with friends, usually being home servers or NAS.</p>

							<p></p>
							<p>I was born in Australia and spent much of my life in Warrandyte on the Yarra river however now am living in Fitzroy. My main hobbies are surfing, snowboarding, riding however I also enjoy the more relaxing pleasures of life as I love to read as well as bake. If I am being truthful, IT has never been something I consider myself particularly interested in however this class as an elective has sparked an interest which I would like to grow further. My experience within IT comes mainly from my own business which operates partially on the online market, so this has required me to increase my skills and understanding to best operate my business.</p>

								<h1>Comparison of our career plans</h1>
								<img src="images/CareerPlans.png">
							</header>
							<p>
								As a group we all come from very different backgrounds and are a diverse group of ages therefore it is not unreasonable to expect that we would have very different goals and expectations for our future careers. Heather, Joshua and Kobi share a common goal in aiming to work as a cyber security analyst with Heather and Joshua both having backgrounds in working in cyber security with Heather involved in working for governments and banks and Joshua having experience working in defence which requires large amounts of cyber security capabilities. Davids role differs as he aims to work in IT systems administration which is a broader role which would include operating sometimes in cyber security however would also allow him to branch out an perform other roles. Solomons role is similar to David and would primarily work in maintaining existing systems as well as solving any issues that occur day to day which is a similar requirement to that of David. Nicholas has the most different role in comparison to the group as he will not be performing much physical IT development work and would rather work in accessing business performance and opportunities within the IT sector. All these roles will require a large amount of technical experience and understanding, and all possess the potential for future growth or job changes, yet all are diverse roles and will require different tasks to be completed in day-to-day work.
