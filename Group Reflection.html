										<b>What went well</b>
										<br>
At the end of the assignment there was more co-operation between members of the team than there was before. By the end of the assignment, members started reviewing work and felt some ownership about the overall quality of the assignment.
<br>
<br>
<b>What could be improved</b>
<br>
We need to be able to meet our deadlines better, read and comprehend the assignment and ask for help more when we need it. The due dates have a reason because it affects the next piece of work. I think we needed to have sat down and had some time estimates to show how long each task would take but I do not think any of us knew how long tasks would take.
<br>
<br>
<b>At least one thing that was surprising</b>
<br>
<br>
I thought after the mad rush to finish assignment 2 that people would have been keen not to have made the same mistakes but we lost the first week and continued to miss due dates.
<br>
<br>
<b>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</b>
<br>
I learnt that different people have different motivational needs. We are a very diverse group! </p>
									<h2>David</h2>
									<p>

										<br>
										<b>What went well</b>
										<br>
										From what had happened in Assignment 2 we definitely were working better together from the outset of this assignment. We also had far better collaboration together making sure that everything was up to the standard we wanted, reviewing each others work and giving feedback consistently.
										<br>
										<br>
										<b>What could be improved</b>
										<br>
										We still ran into issues getting everything done on time, as well as getting notice from people when things were done fast enough to have a quick turn around for providing review and feedback.
										<br>
										<br>
										<b>At least one thing that was surprising</b>
										<br>
										After the plan we had come up with in Assignment 2 I was surprised that it turned into a more difficult project to complete, and get a product going than we had initially had it seem, even taking into account the limitations we were already aware of.
										<br>
										<br>
										<b>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</b>
										<br>
										Making sure you have clear communication that is supportive and never accusatory. When someone had made a mistake with how they have worded something or approached something it was important to make sure when addressing such things that the person didn’t feel attacked by your attempt to assist them.
										<br>

									<h2>Joshua</h2>
									<p>

										<br>
										<b>What went well</b>
										<br>
										For assignment 3, we amped up our weekly meetings from one to occasionally three a week to spur on progress, increasing our productivity and ensuring we were all on the same page project wise. I found that by splitting up the assignment into sections and assigning each section to a particular person was a great way to ensure accountability and that these tasks were completed. This was enhanced using Trello as it gave a visual representation of outstanding tasks and those that were completed.
										<br>
										<br>
										<b>What could be improved</b>
										<br>
										There could have been improvements to the speed at which work was completed to free up time on some of the more technical aspects of the projects. We also could have improved on our completion and critiquing of our project artifacts.
										<br>
										<br>
										<b>At least one thing that was surprising</b>
										<br>
										One thing I found surprising is the increased amount of reviewing and critiquing we did on each other’s work; I feel like we moved past being overly polite with each other and worked on hashing out each other’s work.
										<br>
										<br>
										<b>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</b>
										<br>
										During this course, I have learnt that the best way to work as a group is to communicate with each other as much as possible, and to always ask questions, even if you think they are not relevant.
										<br>
									</p>
									<h2>Nicholas</h2>
									<p>
										<br>
										<b>What went well</b>
										<br>
										The group seemed to really want to improve further with this assignment we were able to discuss openly our thoughts and ideas without any other member shutting down the conversation or the ideas. We also were able to have at least 1–2, hour long meetings each week meant no one felt lost or confused.
										<br>
										<br>
										<b>What could be improved</b>
										<br>
										We had made some mistakes at the start of the assignment with a lack of communication between all team members and as a result it did cause some small issues with the group and at least in my personal case I felt like I was trying to ensure that the mistakes didn’t happen again and this as a result caused myself some stress.
										<br>
										<br>
										<b>At least one thing that was surprising</b>
										<br>
										What I found surprising was just how hard it is to create an idea like a magic mirror. I initially believed it would be a quick process and would only take 6-12 months to complete however through the process of going about this process I realised that it is clearly far more work than I originally thought.
										<br>
										<br>
										<b>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</b>
										<br>
										The main thing that I learned about groups is that communication is key and in cased where people do not effectively communicate issues will arise.

									<h2>Solomon</h2>
									<p>
										<br>
										<b>What went well</b>
										<br>
										As this was the first time, I had worked in a group remotely I thought the whole process went smoothly and better than I had expected. I thought the assignment was broken down well and the workload was done efficiently. It seemed to naturally move into the roles that suited them best.
										<br>
										<br>
										<b>What could be improved</b>
										<br>
											I think regarding communication and meetings I improved over time.  For my part I could have done more preparation going into meetings to avoid needless stress because I was not as organized as I could have been. I should have read the assignment spec earlier and reread it more often.
										<br>
										<br>
										<b>At least one thing that was surprising</b>
										<br>
										I was surprised by the progress I made so quickly and there was not any friction or even small disagreements. All in all, it was a pleasant experience. I thought it was going to be a more stressful ordeal than it was though that is not to say it was not challenging.
										<br>
										<br>
										<b>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</b>
										<br>
										The initial foreign feeling fades over time - quicker than I anticipated. Communication is as important as it was made out to be going into this group assignment. I learned the sooner questions are asked, and issues are resolved faster.
										<br>
										<br>
									 </p>
									<h2>Group Reflection</h2>
									<p>
										<br>
										<b>What went well</b>
										<br>
										As a group we were able to work upon our individual strengths and cover for those who may have a particular weakness in a certain area. As we got to know each other we learnt we could have more honest conversations without causing offence. Everyone was asking more questions of one another and started to raise opposing opinions. We became more familiar with the tools and everyone started to see the value in them and started to interact with them more.
										<br>
										<br>
										<b>What could be improved</b>
										<br>
										Our communication again let us down at the start, this left us scrambling again at the end of the assignments. At the start of the last two assignments there was no communications, but this increased as tentative due dates were missed. This also led to some members of the team feeling anxious as they tried to avert the mad rush to finish everything at the end. People were also reluctant to review each other’s work which slowed things down immensely.
										<br>
										<br>
										<b>At least one thing that was surprising</b>
										<br>
										What was surprising was the amount of work involved. That what we thought were simple concepts to achieve in the project were rather quite difficult. What first looked like simple HTML/CSS skills quickly expanded into realizing that it needed scripts and had to store some data and how does one reuse that data? Everything from: the report, to the web site, the supporting documents, to the actual project took much longer than expected.
										<br>
										<br>
										<b>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</b>
										<br>
										Although it is not a new idea in the case of this group assignment communication has been key. That conversations need to be frequent and honest. The conversations need to be constructive and that team members need to accept this feedback as being for the benefit of the project and hence the team and is not to be taken personally. Working in teams means that each member is reliant on individuals for timely response so they can continue their work, and to raise issues quickly so as not to create larger problems. If unsure to always ask questions of the team as others may have the same question.
That the overall quality of the project cannot be achieved individually but needs a group effort and that feedback via reviews, if accepted is a way of achieving this.
